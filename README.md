# Odense Manifesto

This repository contains the artifacts and knowledge collected from a working session held at [ICSA 2025](https://conf.researchr.org/home/icsa-2025).

The title of the working session was:

> **Dear Academia, architect for the future, for sure, but please don’t forget about the present. Best regards, industry**

The abstract for the working session:

Academic researchers look and should look into the future; they should be “architecting for the next generation of intelligent systems”. Industrial practitioners should create today’s systems to their customer’s satisfaction. Systems should be fit for use, have good quality, and be delivered within agreed time and budget. The latter is not easy and many IT projects fail.

How do academics’ and practitioners’ goals align; are they far from each other? Many will agree that there is some distance, and also that bridging or narrowing the gap between academia and industry is both important and challenging. In this working session, we welcome academics, industrial practitioners and students to meet, exchange viewpoints and discuss how we together can move things in the right direction.

Examples of subjects for discussion:

1. Should industry change some ways of working and/or thinking to facilitate better knowledge transfer from academia?
2. Should academia adjust curricula (or even research agendas) to better help industry
3. Are students properly prepared for the challenges that are waiting “on the other side”?

Dear Academia, Students and Industry

Thanks a lot for your participation. We really appreciate it and enjoyed the working session. We are working on digesting the input, and you will hear from us soon on this channel about how we suggest to follow up on the session.

We want to make the Odense Manifesto together, in this great community!

Stay tuned!

Best regards, Agnete, Jens and Morten, Mjølner
